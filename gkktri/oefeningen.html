              <div class="col-lg-6">
                <p>The following are basic swim sets that you can combine in various ways into a single swim session. For example, following the warm-up, you may start the session with a speed skills set, followed by an anaerobic endurance set and
                  then
                  an
                  aerobic endurance set, before the cooldown.</p>
                <p>The typical order for ability sets within a single training session is aerobic endurance (AE) and/or speed skills (SS) as warm-up, followed by muscular force (MF), anaerobic endurance endurance (AnE), and muscular endurance
                  (ME).
                  The
                  cooldown is commonly AE and/or SS. For example, if the main set (the portion that is neither warm-up nor cooldown) of the workout includes MF and ME, the order of all the sets within session from warm-up through cooldown will be
                  as
                  follows: 1st set: SS → 2nd set: MF → 3rd set: ME → 4th set: AE.
                </p>
              </div>
              <div class="col-lg-6">
                <p>A common exception is to insert an AE or SS set within the main set to allow a long recovery between high-effort sets.</p>
                <p> The MF, ME, and AnE ability sets are always a part of the main set - the primary portions of the workout that are neither warm-up nor cooldown. They should always be preceded by a warm-up. Note that the more intense the main
                  set of
                  the
                  workout, the longer the warm-up must be.</p>
                <p>The intensities for most of the workouts below are based on pace; heart rate monitors are difficult to use while swimming. See swim-pace zones.</p>

                  Following an extensive warm-up including short, fast repeats (such as SS1), do 1 to 3 sets of 3 intervals of 25 meters each. Wear a T-shirt or other such drag device, or use paddles for each interval. The purpose of using a drag
                  device or paddles is to increase stress on the muscles and therefore generate greater force. Take a long (40-60 seconds), standing recovery at the wall after each. Between sets, swim easily as described for AE1 (above) or for 25
                  to 50 meters. The first time you do MF1, do only 1 set of 3 intervals. Gradually increase the number of sets. Stop this set at the first sign of shoulder discomfort, which is an indicator of poor swim skills. Instead of
                  continuing, go to the SS1 set to improve your technique before returning to the MF1 sets.
