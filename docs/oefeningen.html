              <div class="col-lg-6">
                <p>The following are basic swim sets that you can combine in various ways into a single swim session. For example, following the warm-up, you may start the session with a speed skills set, followed by an anaerobic endurance set and
                  then
                  an
                  aerobic endurance set, before the cooldown.</p>
                <p>The typical order for ability sets within a single training session is aerobic endurance (AE) and/or speed skills (SS) as warm-up, followed by muscular force (MF), anaerobic endurance endurance (AnE), and muscular endurance
                  (ME).
                  The
                  cooldown is commonly AE and/or SS. For example, if the main set (the portion that is neither warm-up nor cooldown) of the workout includes MF and ME, the order of all the sets within session from warm-up through cooldown will be
                  as
                  follows: 1st set: SS â†’ 2nd set: MF â†’ 3rd set: ME â†’ 4th set: AE.
                </p>
              </div>
              <div class="col-lg-6">
                <p>A common exception is to insert an AE or SS set within the main set to allow a long recovery between high-effort sets.</p>
                <p> The MF, ME, and AnE ability sets are always a part of the main set - the primary portions of the workout that are neither warm-up nor cooldown. They should always be preceded by a warm-up. Note that the more intense the main
                  set of
                  the
                  workout, the longer the warm-up must be.</p>
                <p>The intensities for most of the workouts below are based on pace; heart rate monitors are difficult to use while swimming. See swim-pace zones.</p>

                  Following an extensive warm-up including short, fast repeats (such as SS1), do 1 to 3 sets of 3 intervals of 25 meters each. Wear a T-shirt or other such drag device, or use paddles for each interval. The purpose of using a drag
                  device or paddles is to increase stress on the muscles and therefore generate greater force. Take a long (40-60 seconds), standing recovery at the wall after each. Between sets, swim easily as described for AE1 (above) or for 25
                  to 50 meters. The first time you do MF1, do only 1 set of 3 intervals. Gradually increase the number of sets. Stop this set at the first sign of shoulder discomfort, which is an indicator of poor swim skills. Instead of
                  continuing, go to the SS1 set to improve your technique before returning to the MF1 sets.

                  Below are basic run workouts for triathlon grouped according to the fice abilities described in Chapter 6: aerobic endurance (AE), muscular force (MF), speed skills (SS), muscular endurance (ME), and anaerobic endurance (AnE).
                  These workouts may be considered modules that can be paired with others to create unique sessions. Combining multiple abilities into one workout is most commonly done in the build period of the season.
                </p>
                <p>
                  The MF, ME and AnE workouts listed below should be preceded by a warm-up. You should perform these three ability categories only in the main set - the primary portion of the workout that is neither warm-up nor cooldown. Note that
                  the more intense the main set of the workout, the longer your warm-up should be. AE and SS workouts may also be in the main sets and are commonly part of the warm-up and cooldown.

              </div>
              <div class="col-lg-6">
                <p>
                  Workout intensities are described here with pace and heart rate. See table 4.4 for run heart rate zones and table 4.6 for run pace zones determined by using a GPS device, a measured course, or a track. As explained in the section
                  "Zone Agreement" in chapter 4, heart rate and pace zones don't always align. If you have both a heart rate monitor and a GPS device, pace is used to evaluate performance, while heart rate expresses effort. Pace (or speed) is the
                  preferred metric for most workouts because the goal of training is to improve performance measurably. Although not reflective of workout accomplishment, heart rate may also be used as an indirect way of expressing intensity. Some
                  workouts rely heavily on heart rate. For very brief intervals, as in MF and AnE sessions, and for SS workouts, heart rate is of limited value.

                <p class="card-text">
                  This workout is done in zone 1, preferably on a flat, soft surface such as a park or golf course. You can instead use a treadmill for these at any time of the year, especially if flat courses are not available. The purpose is
                  active recovery following a hard workout in the past day or so. Most age-group athletes will be better off swimming or cycling for recovery because of the risk for an injury resulting from running on tired legs. Novices generally
                  recover faster by taking time off from exercise. Cross-training in other sports may also be beneficial for recovery, especially in the prep and base periods. Recovery workouts are not scheduled in the annual training plan but are
                  an integral part of training throughout the season. The duration or TSS for this workout should be the lowest in a given week of training.

                <p class="card-text">
                  AeT is explained in chapter 4 under the heading "Intensity Reference Points". A primary reason for doing this workout is to improve aerobic fitness by increasing your physical capacity for delivering and using oxygen to produce
                  energy in muscle.
                </p>
                <p class="card-text">
                  Use a heart rate monitor to gauge intensity. Your AeT heart rate is approximately 30 bpm below your anaerobic threshold heart rate (see "Setting Training Zones" in chapter 4 for details). Following a warm-up, run from 30 minutes to
                  2 hours at your AeT heart rate plus or minus 2 bpm on a flat to gently rolling course or indoor trainer. The longer your intended race, the longer the AeT portion of the workout should be. For sprint- and Olympic-distance triathlon
                  training, the AeT portion is 30 to 45 minutes. If you are training for a half-Ironman, run about 1 to 1.5 hours at AeT heart rate. Ironman athletes should do AeT portions of 1.5 to 2 hours. Build to these durations over several
                  weeks with weekly AeT workouts. If you are also using a GPS device, when the workout is over, divide the normalized graded pace (NGP) for the AeT portion by your average heart rate for the same portion to find your efficiency
                  factor (EF) for this session. An increasing EF over time indicates that your aerobic fitness is improving. Note that EF rises and falls over several sessions, but the trend should show an increase if your training is going well.
                  You can also use the AeT workout as a test for aerobic endurance following a rest-and-recovery periode (see "T1: Aerobic Threshold (AeT) Test" below). This workout should be done year-round, initially for building and later on for
                  maintaining AE. To maintain AE, do this workout about half as frequently as when you were initially building your aerobic fitness.

                  3. You can also use an indoor trainer by frequently changing the grade or speed to increase the workload. The purpose of this workout is to boost your body's capacity for processing oxygen to produce energy.

                  The purpose is to build greater force by strengthening your running muscles. Combining the greater force produced from doing this workout with the increased cadence of SS training results in improved running power. This workout has
                  the potential for high reward, but it also involves high risk. Avoid this workout if you are prone to foot, achilles tendon, calf, or knee injuries. If your legs are fully capable of handling the stress, you may increase the
                  workload by wearing a weight vest equal to 5 to 10 percent of your body weight. Force reps are done as follows:

                <ul class="card-text">
                  <li>Find a short, steep (grade of 6 to 8 percent) hill that you can run to as warm-up. Grass or dirt is the preferred surface. The hill should be at least 10 meters from base to peak.</li>
                  <li>After warming up thoroughly, walk to the base of the hill and come to a complete stop. Then quickly run up the hill with great effort on each push-off.</li>
                  <li>Your stride length is determined by the steepness of the hill and by whether or not you are wearing a weight vest.</li>
                  <li>Keep your head up in a neutral posture as you run up the hill. Do <em>not</em> look at your feet.</li>
                  <li>Produce a total of 10 to 20 maximal-effort steps on each brief hill repeat. A "step" is a footstrike with either foot. The fewer steps you take in one ascent of the hill, the greater the effort should be.</li>
                  <li>After each hill rep, <em>walk</em> slowly back down the hill and fully recover for 2 to 3 minutes. Don't run during the recoveries or try to make the recoveries briefer. Doing so will only increase the risk and decrease the
                    potential reward. The purpose of this workout is to increase maximum muscular strength, not to build endurance. Allow your muscles to recover before doing the next rep.</li>

                  (see table 4.1 for RPE zones). Heart rate may reach zone 5a by the time you are at the top of the hill later in the workout but will be mostly in zones 3 and 4 early in the session, even though RPE is appropriately high. Maintain a
                  "proud" posture -head up and tall- while going up the hills. To recover, slowly jog or walk back down the hill before starting the next rep. If you are wearing a weight vest, only walk down the hill to prevent an injury to the

                  Focus on one aspect of your technique on each stride. This could be, for example, cadence. Count your right footstrikes for the 20 seconds with a goal of 28 to 32. A variation is to run these barefoot, but only if the grass is free
                  of sharp objects and there are no breaks in the skin on your feet. Heart rate has no significance for this workout.

                  Within an endurance run such as AE3 above, randomly insert several 20-second accelerations to a speed faster than 5-km pace (heart rate is not a good indicator of intensity for these). The primary focus should be on your technique,
                  such as working on a flat footstrike. Other goals may be maintaining a relaxed posture or a high cadence. Recover for several minutes between these pick-ups by returning to zone 2 steady running.

                  build to about 15 minutes in a session (e.g., 5 x 3 minutes). A GPS device is the preferred tool for measuring intensity during this workout. Heart rate lag makes heart rate monitors ineffective for gauging intensity for such short
                  intervals. If you don't have a GPS device, run at an RPE of 9 on a scale of 0 to 10 for each interval (see chapter 4 for details on RPE). Concentrate on good running technique.

                  This test of your aerobic fitness is best done after 3 to 5 days of greatly reduced training to allow rest and recovery. Follow the instructions for workout AE2 above. While you may also be doing the AE2 workout during a "normal",
                  non-recovery training week, your results after a short rest-and-recovery break from hard training are a better indicator of your progress because fatigue is unlikely to be a mitigating factor. As with the AE2 workout above,
                  following the session, divide your NGP for the AeT portion by your average heart rate for the same portion to determine your current EF. As your aerobic fitness improves over time, your EF value will trend upward. During a period
                  of greatly reduced training, such as at the end of the season, you should expect your EF to decline steadily, indication a loss of aerobic fitness. That is normal and to be expected because fitness must subside at certain times of

                  The purpose of this test is to determine your functional threshold pace (FTPa) and functional threshold heart rate (FTHR) for running in order to set your training zones. Do this test following 3 to 5 days of active rest and
                  recovery. A road course should be relatively flat for this test, or do it on a track (preferred). Use the same course every time. (Most treadmills can't be calibrated closely enough to attain the accuracy required for this test.)
                  Run as if you are in a race that lasts 20 minutes. Hold back slightly in the first 5 minutes (most athletes start much too fast). Every 5 minutes, decide whether you should go slightly faster or more slowly for the next 5 minutes.
                  Cool down afterward with easy jogging and walking. Following the workout, find your average heart rate for the 20-minute test. <em>Subtract</em> 5 percent and you have a good estimate of your run FTHR. Then use table 4.4 to compute
                  heart rate training zones. If you are using a GPS device on a road course, <em>add</em> 5 percent to your NGP to determine FTPa. If you performed the test on a track, use the track measurements to determine pace and also <em>add</em>
                  5 percent for an estimate of FTPa. Table 4.6 may then be used to set your pace training zones.

                  a road test or the actual pace from a track-based test for the 5-minute test portion is a good predictor of your pace at aerobic capacity. This test may be done in place of a costly clinical test of VO2max.

                  The following basic bike workouts for triathletes are categorized according to the five abilities described in Chapter 6: aerobic endurance (AE), muscular force (MF), speed skills (SS), muscular endurance (ME), and anaerobic
                  endurance (AnE). By combining portions of the workouts that follow, you can create new workouts, including multiple-ability workouts, to match your specific needs. Merging multiple abilities into one workout is most commonly done
                  in the build period of the season (see Chapters 7 and 8 for more on periodization of training).
                </p>
                <p>
                  The MF, ME, and AnE workouts listed below
                  should be preceded by a warm-up. You should
                  use these three ability categories only in the main
                  set - the primary portion of the workout that is
                  neither warm-up nor cooldown. Note that the
                  more intense the main set of the workout, the
                  longer your warm-up should be.</p>

                  Workout intensities are described with power
                  and heart rate. See Table 4.3 for bike heart rate
                  zones and Table 4.5 for bike power zones. Note
                  that heart rate and power zones don't always
                  agree. You may want to reread "Zone Agreement"
                  in Chapter 4, the section that discusses
                  their relationship. If you have both devices, use
                  the power meter to measure performance and
                  the heart rate monitor to gauge effort. The power
                  meter is the preferred intensity gauge for most
                  workouts. There are some exceptions, which are
                  described below.

                  the small chain ring on a flat course. Pedal with
                  a comfortably high cadence. Alternatively, you

                  any time of the year, especially if flat road courses
                  are not available. Other options for recovery in
                  the prep and early base periods include crosstraining
                  workouts, such as cross-country skiing
                  on a relatively flat course, and various health
                  club machines. Note that your heart rate zones

                <p class="card-text">
                  The AeT workout was briefly introduced in
                  Chapter 4 in the section "Intensity Reference
                  Points:' An important purpose of this workout is
                  to boost aerobic Â·fitness by improving the body's
                  capability for delivering and using oxygen to produce
                  energy in muscle. Use a heart rate monitor
                  to gauge the intensity of this workout. Your
                  AeT heart rate is approximately 30 bpm below your anaerobic threshold heart rate (see "Setting
                  Training Zones" in Chapter 4 for details).
                </p>
                <p class="card-text">
                  Following a warm-up, ride at your AeT heart
                  rate plus or minus 2 bpm on a flat to gently rolling
                  course, or on an indoor trainer. The length of
                  time you spend on the AeT portion of the workout
                  depends on the length of your target race. For
                  sprint and Olympic-distance triathlon training,
                  the AeT portion is 1 to 1.5 hours long. If you are
                  training for a half-Ironman, ride 2 to 2.5 hours.
                  Ironman athletes should do an AeT portion of 3
                  to 4 hours. If you are also using a power meter,
                  when the workout is over, divide the normalized
                  power for the AeT portion by your average heart
                  rate for the same portion to find your efficiency
                  factor (EF) for this session. An increasing EF over
                  time indicates that your AeT is improving. Note
                  that it seldom rises linearly but instead "ratchets"
                  up over several weeks as fitness improves.
                </p>
                <p class="card-text">
                  You can also use the AeT workout as a test
                  of AE (see "Tl: Aerobic Threshold [AeT] Test"
                  below). Do this workout year-round, initially to
                  build and later on to maintain your AE. When
                  you are using it to maintain AE, do this workout
                  about half as frequently as when you were initially
                  building aerobic fitness.

                  This workout develops AE while also building
                  ME. After a warm-up, ride for an hour or more
                  on a course with small hills while staying mostly
                  in heart rate zone 2, but with frequent, brief
                  increases to zone 3. Remain seated on most hills.
                  You can also do this workout on an indoor trainer
                  by frequently shifting gears to increase the load
                  and simulate hills. Accumulate several minutes
                  of zone 3 in this manner within the ride. A common
                  variation of this workout is to run 15 to 20 minutes immediately after the ride. The purpose
                  of the workout is to boost your body's capacity
                  for processing oxygen to produce energy.

                  This is an interval workout involving 1 to 3 sets
                  with 3 reps within each set. That means a total
                  of 3 to 9 reps within the session. As with all such
                  high-intensity workouts, warm up well before
                  starting the reps. Do this workout no more than
                  twice per week with at least 48 hours between
                  workouts. Do not do this workout if you have
                  knee problems. The workout is done as follows:
                </p>
                <ul class="card-text">
                  <li>Find a short - about 30 to 50 yards or meters
                    long - steep hill. The grade should be about
                    6 to 8 percent. There should be very little
                    traffic.</li>
                  <li>
                    For each rep, select a high gear, such as
                    53 x 16 or 50 x 15. The stronger you are, the
                    higher and more challenging the gear can be.
                    Your gear selection should be high enough
                    that your highest cadence is less than 50 rpm
                    by the end of a rep. The steepness of the hill
                    will also play a role in gear selection, so you
                    will need to experiment with gearing the first
                    time you do this workout. Err on the low-gear
                    (easy) side at first.
                  </li>
                  <li>
                    Coast back down to the base of the hill
                    in that high (hard) gear and almost come
                    to a complete stop while staying balanced.
                  </li>
                  <li>
                    As you start up the hill, stay seated. Do not
                    stand. Drive the pedals down with a maximal
                    effort for 5 to 10 revolutions. A revolution is
                    1 complete pedal stroke, so, for example,
                    count your right foot driving the pedal down 8 times. Alternate the leg you count for
                    subsequent reps because you are likely to
                    push harder with the "counted " leg.
                  </li>
                  <li>
                    After a rep, shift to a low (easy) gear and
                    pedal gently for 3 to 5 minutes to allow
                    recovery. Do not shorten the recovery time
                    between reps because this will reduce the
                    workout benefit of strength development.
                    Be sure your legs are recovered before doing
                    the next rep.</li>
                  <li>
                    Repeat the above steps 2 more times for a
                    total of 3 reps. That's 1 set. If you are doing
                    a second set (do only 1 set the first time
                    you try this workout), pedal easily for 5 to
                    10 minutes after each set to ensure full
                    recovery. Be aware of how your knees feel
                    on each rep. This is a high-risk, high-reward
                    workout. At the first sign of any tenderness,
                    stop the workout. Do not continue, even if the
                    tenderness in your knees is only slight.</li>

                  Select a course that includes several moderately
                  steep hills with a grade of up to about 6 percent
                  that take 2 to 5 minutes to climb. Stay seated on
                  all hills, pedaling from the hips. That means little
                  or no rocking of the upper body. Cadence on the
                  climbs is 60 rpm or higher. Increase power to
                  zone 4 or 5 on each hill. Ride in power zones 1
                  and 2 on the latter portions of the course. Power
                  is the preferred gauge of intensity for this workout,
                  but if you are using only a heart rate monitor,
                  stay below zone 5a on the hills. On an indoor
                  trainer, you can simulate hills by placing a 5- to
                  7-inch riser under the front wheel and selecting high gears and a wheel-resistance setting that
                  will produce a slow cadence. Do this workout no

                  between them. Maintain power zone 5 for each
                  uphill climb. Your heart rate may reach zone 5a

                <p class="card-text">
                  After warming up, do 3 to 5 work intervals in
                  zone 3 with brief recoveries. The work intervals
                  may be 12 to 20 minutes long with recoveries
                  that are about one-fourth as long. For
                  example, following a 16-minute interval, recover
                  for 4 minutes. This workout should be done on
                  a mostly flat road course or an indoor trainer.
                  Power is the preferred measure of intensity for
                  this workout, but you can also use heart rate.
                  If you are training only with a heart rate monitor,
                  the work interval starts as soon as you begin
                  pedaling hard - <em>not</em> when zone 3 is achieved.
                  There will be a time lag during the interval as
                  your heart rate catches up to your effort. During
                  these times, use a perceived exertion of 5 to
                  6 on a scale of O to 10 (see Chapter 4 for details
                  on rating of perceived exertion, or RPE). Avoid
                  roads with heavy traffic and frequent stop signs.
                  Stay in an aerodynamic position for each interval.
                  Recover by using easy pedaling in zone 1.
                  Tempo intervals are a foundational workout for
                  long-course triathlon preparation.

                <p class="card-text">
                  On a relatively flat course or an indoor trainer,
                  complete 3 to 5 work intervals with a duration
                  of 6 to 12 minutes. Each work interval is
                  done in zone 4. Power is the preferred gauge of
                  intensity for this workout, but heart rate may
                  be used. If you are using heart rate, the timed
                  interval begins as soon as the hard effort begins,
                  not when the heart rate achieves zone 4. During
                  this period of increasing heart rate, estimate
                  intensity based on a perceived exertion of 7 on
                  a scale of O to 10 (see Chapter 4 for details on
                  RPE). Recover in zone 1 with easy pedaling for
                  about one-fourth of the preceding interval. For
                  example, after a 6-minute interval, recover for
                  90 seconds with easy pedaling in zone 1. During
                  the first such workout of the new season, the
                  duration of the work intervals should typically
                  total 12 minutes or less (e.g., 2 x 6 minutes).
                  Gradually, over a few weeks, increase the combined
                  work-interval duration to 30 to 50 minutes
                  (e.g., 5 x 6 minutes or 4 x 12 minutes). Stay
                  relaxed and aerodynamic, and listen closely to
                  your breathing. The work-interval intensity is
                  very similar to that of an Olympic-distance triathlon.
                  Pedal with a cadence similar to what you
                  would use at such a race distance. An optional
                  variation that challenges you to work harder is
                  to shift occasionally between your "normal" gear
                  for this intensity and a higher (harder) gear.

                <h6 class="card-title">ME3: Hill Cruise Intervals</h6>
                <p class="card-text">
                  This session is the same as ME2 cruise intervals,
                  except it is done on a hill with a long, low gradient,
                  such as 2 to 4 percent, or into a strong head
                  wind. Select a hill that has light traffic and no
                  stop signs. As with ME2, a power meter is the
                  preferred tool for measuring intensity while you
                  are riding in zone 4, but a heart rate monitor may
                  be used. If you are training only with a heart rate
                  monitor, the work interval starts as soon as you
                  begin pedaling hard - not when zone 4 is ultimately
                  achieved. Note that you may not achieve
                  heart rate zone 4 during the first or perhaps even
                  the second interval. That's common. During these
                  periods of slowly increasing heart rate, use a perceived
                  exertion of 7 on a scale of O to 10 to gauge
                  intensity (see Chapter 4 for details on RPE). Stay
                  in the aero position for each climb, and work on a
                  smooth stroke with minimal upper-body motion.
                  Recover after each climb by turning around and
                  returning to the bottom of the hill in zone 1. This
                  descent means that the recovery intervals will be
                  longer than when you are doing ME2 intervals,
                  but with a somewhat increased intensity for each
                  interval and a slightly greater benefit for MF.
                  A variation on this workout is to shift between
                  your "normal" gear for such a climb and a higher
                  (harder) gear every 30 seconds or so. Be sure to
                  stay in zone 4 when doing this.

                <p class="card-text">
                  This workout is very similar to ME2 but somewhat
                  more challenging. On a mostly flat course
                  with little traffic and no stop signs, or on an
                  indoor trainer, do 3 to 5 intervals with durations
                  of 4 to 8 minutes in power zone 4 or
                  heart rate zones 4 and 5a. After each interval,
                  recover for one-fourth of the duration of the preceding interval. The combined total of the
                  work intervals in a single session may be 12 to
                  25 minutes (for example, 3 x 4 minutes or 5 x 5
                  minutes). During each work interval, shift to a
                  higher (harder) gear or increase your cadence to
                  build gradually to the top of zone 4 (power) or
                  5a (heart rate), taking 1 to 2 minutes to do so.
                  Then gradually reduce the intensity by shifting
                  to a lower (easier) gear or by reducing cadence
                  so that you slowly drop back to the bottom of
                  zone 4, taking 1 or 2 minutes to do so. Continue
                  this pattern throughout each interval. Power
                  is the preferred tool for gauging intensity for
                  this workout, but a heart rate monitor may be
                  used. If you are training only with a heart rate
                  monitor, the work interval starts as soon as you
                  begin pedaling hard - not when zone 4 is finally
                  achieved. You may not achieve heart rate zone
                  4 during the first two intervals. That's common.
                  During these periods of slowly increasing heart
                  rate, use a perceived exertion of 6 to 8 on a scale
                  of O to 10 to gauge intensity (see Chapter 4 for
                  details on RPE).</p>
                <p class="card-text">
                  This is an advanced workout that shouldn't
                  be attempted until you have done 30 minutes or
                  more of combined work-interval time with workout
                  ME2. The first of these workouts in a season
                  should include short intervals (e.g., 4 minutes)
                  with a low total combined interval time (e.g.,
                  12 minutes).

                  Ride with a group of triathletes that includes
                  some who are somewhat stronger riders than
                  you. There is no structure to this ride. Push
                  yourself to stay with the faster riders for as long
                  as you can. If you are unable to ride at the front
                  with them, sit in by drafting at the back of the
                  group or break off and ride alone. The intensity
                  goal is to achieve zone 5 (power) or zone
                  5b (heart rate) for a few minutes several times
                  during the ride. Be cautious with this workout,
                  not only in terms of how intense it may become,
                  but also in regard to road safety; pay attention
                  to traffic and to other riders who may not be

                  After a long warm-up, on a mostly flat course
                  with no stop signs and light traffic, do several
                  work intervals, each with a duration of 30 seconds
                  to 4 minutes. Recover with easy pedaling
                  in zone 1 for as long as the previous interval. As
                  your fitness improves, reduce the recovery time
                  by half. Start with about 5 minutes of total interval
                  time within a workout (e.g., 10 x 30 seconds)
                  and gradually, over several sessions, build to
                  about 15 minutes in a session (e.g., 5 x 3 minutes).
                  A power meter is the preferred tool for measuring
                  intensity here. Heart rate lag makes heart rate
                  monitors ineffective for gauging intensity. The
                  goal intensity is power zone 5. If you don't have
                  a power meter, use a rating of perceived exertion
                  of 9 on a scale of 0 to 10 for each interval (see
                  Chapter 4 for details on RPE). Cadence for these

                  This test of your aerobic fitness is best done after
                  3 to 5 days of greatly reduced training to allow rest
                  and recovery. Follow the instructions for workout
                  AE2 above. Although you may also be doing the
                  AE2 workout during a "normal" training week,
                  your results after a short rest-and-recovery break
                  from hard training are a better indicator of your
                  progress because fatigue is unlikely to be a mitigating
                  factor. As with the AE2 workout above,
                  following the session, divide your normalized
                  power for the AeT portion by your average heart
                  rate for the same portion to determine your current
                  EF. Your EF value will increase over time as
                  your aerobic fitness improves. During a period of
                  greatly reduced training, such as at the end of the
                  season, you should expect your EF to decrease,
                  indicating a loss of aerobic fitness. That is normal
                  and to be expected because fitness must decline
                  at certain times of the year. This test should be

                  threshold heart rate (FTHR). Do this test
                  following 3 to 5 days of active rest and recovery.
                  Find a stretch of road with a wide bike lane,
                  light traffic, no stop signs, and few intersections
                  and corners that is flat to slightly uphill (grade
                  of less than 3 percent). You will probably need
                  5 to 10 miles depending on how fast you are. A
                  safe course is critical. (You may also do this on an
                  indoor trainer.) Throughout the test, keep your head up so you can see ahead. Ride as if you are
                  in a race that lasts 20 minutes. Hold back slightly
                  in the first 5 minutes (most athletes start much
                  too fast) . Every 5 minutes, decide whether you
                  should go slightly faster or more slowly for the
                  next 5 minutes. After the workout, find your
                  average heart rate for the 20-minute test. Subtract
                  5 percent and you have a good estimate of
                  your bike FTHR. Then use Table 4.3 to compute
                  your training zones. To determine FTPo from the
                  same test, subtract 5 percent from your average
                  power (not "normalized" power) and you have a
                  good estimate of FTPo. You can then use Table
                  4.5 to set your power training zones.

                <p class="card-text">
                  This test is done to determine your functional aerobic
                  capacity (V02max) power. It requires a power
                  meter. It may be done in place of a costly clinical
                  test of V02max. This test is best done following
                  reduced training for 3 to 5 days. The course you
                  use for the test should be safe. That means light
                  traffic, no stop signs, few intersections, no turns,
                  and a wide bike lane. For safety, you should look
                  straight ahead throughout the test. Do not ride
                  with your head down. The selected test course
                  should also be a flat to slightly uphill (grade of less
                  than 3 percent) section of road that you can use
                  every time you do this test. (You may also do this
                  on an indoor trainer.) Warm up thoroughly and
                  then do a steady, all-out effort for 5 minutes. Your
                  average power for the 5-minute test portion is a
                  good predictor of your power at aerobic capacity.

                  light traffic, few intersections, no stop signs, and
                  a wide bike lane. Keep your head up throughout
                  the test so you can see traffic and possible road
                  obstacles, such as potholes. The course should
                  be flat to very slightly uphill (grade of less than 2
                  percent). Mark your start point and finish point
                  for later reference, or note landmarks so you can test on the same course every time. (You may
                  also do this on an indoor trainer.) Expect faster
                  times as your AnE and ME improve. In addition
                  to your time, note your average heart rate and
                  normalized power for the test portion in your
                  training diary. You can use any gear combination,

                  These basic combined bike-run workouts are
                  categorized into the five abilities presented in
                  Chapter 6: aerobic endurance (AE), muscular
                  force (MF), speed skills (SS), muscular endurance
                  (ME), and anaerobic endurance (AnE). Combined
                  bike-run workouts are commonly called bricks by
                  triathletes. There are many other possible brick
                  workouts that are variations on these, including
                  multiple-ability workouts that may have two
                  abilities within the bike and run portions or a different ability focus in each of the two sports. For
                  example, the bike or run portion could include
                  both AE and ME. Another variation could focus
                  on AE for the bike portion and ME for the run.
                  The possibilities are many. You can vary the bricks
                  you create to fit your specific needs relative to the
                  anticipated demands of your targeted race. The
                  only limit is your creativity in designing workouts.
                  The merging of two or more abilities into a single
                  brick workout is most commonly done in the
                  build period of the season (see Chapters 7 and 8
                  for more on periodization of training).
                </p>
                <p class="card-text">
                  The order of sports within a brick is typically
                  bike followed by run. But duathletes often
                  do run-bike-run workouts because that's their
                  common race design. You can also do bricks with
                  several alternating stages of the two sports, such
                  as bike-run-bike-run. Such workouts are often
                  done at a running track with a stationary trainer
                  set up nearby for the bike portions. Swim-to-bike
                  bricks are rare, but there is certainly merit
                  in rehearsing the first transition. You will see an
                  example of this below in the SS workouts.
                </p>
                <p class="card-text">
                  When you transition from the bike to the
                  run in one of these brick workouts, it's recommended
                  that you follow the same procedure you
                  intend to use in your targeted race; doing so will
                  serve as practice for your transition in your race.
                  Lay out your transition area to be as similar as
                  possible to the way it will be on race day. As you
                  end the bike ride, quickly and efficiently change
                  shoes and put on any other run clothing while
                  also grabbing whatever food or equipment that
                  you will need.

                  How long should the run portion of a brick
                  be? It depends, of course, on the type of race
                  you are targeting. But it's often best to keep the
                  run portions short because running on legs that
                  are tired from a long bike ride increases your
                  risk for an injury. Even for long-course races, a
                  15-minute run following a long bike ride is beneficial
                  for learning to cope with the strange sensation
                  of running on bike-weary legs. For shortcourse
                  races, a brick that has about the same
                  duration that you expect the combined bike
                  and run portions of the race to have is common.
                  For long-course racing, however, bricks that are
                  equal in duration to the anticipated combined
                  bike and run portions of the race are not recommended
                  because the recovery afterward takes
                  too long.
                </p>
                <p class="card-text">
                  When the bike portion of a brick calls for ME or AnE, the workout should be preceded by
                  a warm-up. (MF workouts are best not done as
                  bricks.) These two ability categories are used only
                  in the brick's main set - the primary portion of the workout that is neither warm-up nor cooldown.
                  Note that the more intense the main set of the
                  workout, the longer your warm-up should be. In
                  a brick, the bike portion always serves as a warmup
                  for the following run.

                  In preparation for a hilly race, design a brick
                  course that closely simulates the race course. This
                  can be a hilly bike and flat run or a flat bike and
                  hilly run, or both the bike and run may be hilly.
                  The emphasis of the workout is on the hilly portions,
                  where you should rehearse proper pacing
                  on the climbs. The bike and run courses should
                  be considerably shorter than those in the race, at
                  about one-half of the race distance or less. On the
                  flat portions, ride and run steadily at an intensity
                  (power, pace, heart rate, or RPE) similar to what
                  you will do in the race. On the uphill portions,
                  increase the power, run speed, or heart rate by

                  your functional threshold power (FTPo). Power is
                  the preferred measurement, but if you are using
                  a heart rate monitor, you are unlikely to achieve
                  heart rates above zone 4 because of heart rate
                  lag. In this case, use a rating of perceived exertion (RPE) of 8 to 9 on a scale of O to 10. Recover after
                  each work interval for a time equal to half of the
                  preceding work-interval time. For example, after
                  a 4-minute work interval, recover for 2 minutes.
                  Accumulate up to about 15 minutes of total work-interval
                  time on the bike. Transition to a run with
                  a duration about half the duration of the preceding
                  bike portion (e.g., if you rode for 60 minutes,
                  run for 30 minutes). During the run and immediately
                  following the transition, include 10 to 20
                  minutes of steady state in pace zone 4 (preferred)
                  or heart rate zone 4.

                  Take your indoor bike trainer to a running track.
                  Run for 10 to 20 minutes in pace (preferred) or
                  heart rate zones 1 to 3 for warm up. Then, on
                  the bike trainer, ride for 5 to 10 minutes while
                  achieving power (preferred) or heart rate zone
                  4 in the last minute or so. Transition to running
                  shoes and complete 2 to 4 work intervals
                  that last 2 to 4 minutes, with intensity rising
                  into pace (preferred) zone 5b on each. You may
                  also do these work intervals with intensity based
                  on an RPE of 8 to 9 on a scale of O to 10. Heart
                  rate is ineffective because of the shortness of the
                  intervals. Recovery intervals are half the duration
                  of the previous work interval and done in
                  zone 1. Return to the bike and again ride 5 minutes,
                  building to zone 4. Repeat this alternating
                  bike-run pattern 1 to 3 more times before cooling
                  down for 10 minutes or so on the bike. Aim
                  for a total of about 20 minutes or 3 miles of work
                  intervals for running.
